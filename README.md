In this demo, I will create a git repo on local machine and then push it to GitHub.

## Steps

1. Type git init - to initiate a git repo
2. Add files to staging area
3. Commit changes
4. Create a empty repo on GitHub.com
5. Copy the newly created empty repo address and pass it to the command - git remote add origin <your-github-repo-address>
6. Check to see all available repo on GitHub with command - git remote -v
7. Finally, issue the command - git push origin <main/master> depending on the version you are using.
